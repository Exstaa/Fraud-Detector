## Fraud Detection Project
## Overview
This project aims to develop a fraud detection system using three different machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree Classifier. The goal is to compare the performance of these algorithms in detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Algorithms Used
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier

## Implementation
The project is implemented using Python programming language and Jupyter Notebook. The dataset is loaded, preprocessed, and split into training and testing sets. Each algorithm is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy

## Conclusion
Based on the experiment results, conclusions are drawn regarding the effectiveness of each algorithm in detecting fraudulent transactions. Insights may be provided on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and potential areas for further improvement.
